 
# What TODO next

dont use mongo, just use postgres?!!

## use test driven dev
`./mng test`


## Mayor objectives:
- port the software to MongoDB, because CouchDB seems quite dead
- port to mongoengine (use mongoengine, thats the only one that seems active)
- update web libs, jquery ect.. use all local libs
- update python / pips, but stay on Py2.7 (because of glass)
- update to modern Django and modern Celery


## Currently stuck at porting and writing unit tests for:

- lenses app // api // GetListOfLenses
  I installed mongoDB locally
  I have to make the mongo connection settings
