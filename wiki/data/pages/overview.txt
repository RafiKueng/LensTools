Twisted:
  * It looks awesome
  * It is built for people who are supposed to understand what they are doing
  * The documentation sucks
  * The examples on how to build anything of any significance are, to this developer, non-existant and/or difficult to find without shelling out for a possibly very-outdated book

Tornado:
  * It looks awesome
  * It is built for people who are supposed to understand what they are doing
  * The documentation is inside the comments on the code which sucks only if youâ€™re not into reading the code
  * It includes a sample application so you can see something other than Hello World
